# Korg Volca Drum Editor for Numerology
 
An editor for the Korg Volca Drum built with Five12's Numerology.  

This patch for Numerology allow you to edit and sequence each voice of the Volca Drum. 

Two seperate patches are included. The first works using the Volca Drum's Split channel mode and is the most comprehensive in terms of features. The second uses the single channel mode and it's a little simpler, but with less control of the parameters. This patch assumes the VD is set to MIDI channel 10.
